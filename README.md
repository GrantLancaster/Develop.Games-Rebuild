# Develop.Games UI Rebuild
Develop.games is a website created by PirateSoftware, which is intended to help people who want to make games but are having a hard time starting. It lays out the steps, as well as provides some resources for people plan out their game. 

## Original Site
https://www.develop.games/ 

## This Rebuild
The goal around this rebuild is to develop a better UI for the site. Currently, it does not have mobile styling, and the desktop styling is a little rough (unnecessary horizontal scrolling, and an intrusive navigation bar). I think that Thor (PirateSoftware) is a genuine, kind, and intelligent person, and what he does for his community, and the game development community in general, is much needed in the today's tech space. He has NOT paid me, this is just a passion project for me, and want to enhance something that helps people achieve their goals.

## Disclaimer
I was not paid for this rebuild.
I was not asked to do this.
