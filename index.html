        <div class="HorizontalLineSeparator"></div>
        <p>
          My name is Jason Thor Hall but I just go by my middle name of Thor. I started in the games industry in 2004 on World of Warcraft Vanilla. I've worked for Blizzard Entertainment, Amazon Games Studios, the United States Department of Energy, and now Pirate Software. I've got three black badges from DEFCON, two for cryptography, and one for telephreaking. I'm a programmer, hacker, game developer, and all around giant nerd.
        </p>
        <p>
          I left all of that behind and started my studio Pirate Software in 2017 and I haven't looked back since. As the studio head I wear a lot of hats. I'm the programmer, writer, designer, game director, social media manager, and tons of other jobs. I feel extremely confident in running my studio and in how far we've come and how everything has turned out. Any decision that I ever make is based on analytics and research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now we are working on an RPG called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/">Heartbound</a>. It's an adventure that focuses heavily on player choice and I stream all of the development live every day on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/piratesoftware">Twitch</a>. Heartbound made it through Steam Greenlight in 11 days as the top voted submission across the entire platform. We then ran a successful Kickstarter campaign that hit 385% of its funding goal. At the time of this writing Heartbound is in Early Access on Steam and voted 97% positive out of 1,213 reviews. It's been translated into six languages and is really well liked all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listed below are all of the bits of advice that I have for anyone wanting to get into making games. Understand that this line of work is not for everyone. It's not easy. It can be boring at times. It can be soul crushing at times. Just like any other job. That being said it can also be the most fulfilling thing you've ever done in your life. There is nothing that compares to someone playing your creation and enjoying it.

        <p>
          What if I told you that you didn't need any? Well guess what. You don't. We live in a time where you can learn anything you need to make a game with relative ease. Despite what you may think none of that comes from natural talent. We all just pour our hours into getting better at what we do. You can do the same. Below you will find some examples of games that are already out there that help reinforce this.

              <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220780/Thomas_Was_Alone/">Thomas Was Alone</a> is made of rectangles. All of it. Even the particles. It will also make you cry. Thomas Was Alone is a masterclass in minimalist art and fantastic voice over. You can make simple shapes. You can learn to make particles out of simple shapes. You can create a shell of a game that accomplishes the same basic goals as Thomas Was Alone. You can make a game.

              <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/410670/Suits_A_Business_RPG/">Suits A Business RPG</a> was made with incredibly simplistic pixel art and drawn pencil images that are scanned into a computer. It's entirely unique and incredible. This shows that you can really break out of standard game visuals and still succeed. You can draw doodles on paper. You can make a game.

              <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/597220/West_of_Loathing/">West of Loathing</a> is the glorious successor to Kingdom of Loathing. It's also entirely stick figures and insane humor. The cartoony simplistic figures really help lean in to the rest of the story and jokes in a way that makes it all even funnier. You can make a stick man. You can make a game.

              <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789570/Nepenthe/">Nepenthe</a> takes a similar route as Suits A Business RPG. It was made entirely in colored pencil, scanned into a computer, and used as tiles and assets. The effect ends up making a really unique and surreal adventure. You can draw doodles on paper. You can make a game.

            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435400/Hidden_Folks/">Hidden Folks</a> is effectively an evolution on Where's Waldo and while it's simple in concept it's super well executed. The wild thing that sets it apart is the audio. Everything... and I do mean everything, is mouth sounds. All of the music, the effects, all of it was made with someones face. It's incredible. You have a face. You can make a game.

            Yes, that's right. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/">Undertale</a> is a damn incredible game. It has a unique combat style, great story, the puzzles are ok, and the dad jokes are plentiful. Toby Fox was a much more novice programmer at the time and the code base has some incredibly odd choices throughout it. Does it matter? Is the game less fun? Protip: It doesn't matter. You can learn programming as you go. You can make a game.

        <h1>What Kind of Game Should I Make?</h1>
        <div class="HorizontalLineSeparator"></div>
        <p>
          Everyone wants to make the biggest most impressive game they've ever seen at first. They want to show it off for clout and admiration from others. They want to make something worthy of praise. Many of us want to make our dream game right off the bat and just amaze everyone with how awesome we are. Don't. Don't make that game as your first game.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you make your dream game it's the same as fighting the final boss at level one. You need to build up a little bit of know-how by grinding lower level mobs first. You need to learn what kind of developer you are. You need to learn what kinds of games you like making not just the ones you like playing. You need to find your style and form your niche in the world of game development. We all have a voice and making something small helps you find yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doesn't mean you need to go sadly run yourself through tutorials or miles of projects that will never see the light of day. It means you should develop something small with the intention of releasing it and getting feedback so you can level up. Play dungeons and dragons and DM a few games with a custom world you built. Make an arcade game, launch it, and get feedback from people. Join a bunch of Game Jams and feel out how you like working with others or what works best for a team. Grow yourself so you can make great games.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best ways to start this process is by building a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vl7BMvzUOhbunJrI_X1gUc6x-LAp3aaBiPwHUf27B70/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.lr899156xjnx">Game Design Document</a>. This is a living document to help you organize your entire project and stay in scope. It also lets you investigate different engines or languages that may work with the kind of game you're making before you commit. Overall a GDD saves you time and money and is always beneficial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with all of my prior experience I had no idea what I was doing when I went indie at first. I had never launched a game outside of a triple A studio. I had never launched a demo or built a community. We used our first game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/454380/Champions_of_Breakfast/">Champions of Breakfast</a> to do that. We went through Steam Greenlight, made all the icons, learned how to build achievements, Steam trading cards, made a Discord, made a Twitter, reached out to streamers, and everything else that a studio needs to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our little game didn't do very well but it taught us everything we needed to know to make <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/">Heartbound</a> succeed. Champions of Breakfast was made in twenty four days from concept to release on Steam and it is by far the most important step we ever took as a studio.

        <div class="HorizontalLineSeparator"></div>
        <p>
          In todays world this is a lot easier than you think. We actually run four game jams a year over on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/piratesoftware">Discord</a> servers specifically to help people get comfortable with making games together. Join game jams there or on <a href="https://itch.io/jams">Itch.io</a>. You can find HUNDREDS of game jams there and really mingle with a bunch of people out there. The more you do this the more confident you will be in your abilities and the more you will learn what you are looking for in a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there it's just a matter of determining how your team is going to run on the financial side of things. This is entirely up to you and the laws of your area. For us we split the sales of our games between the devs working on it. The OST sales are also given entirely to our musician so they get a nice bump for that. It's really important that people are fairly compensated for their work and that the payment structure is defined and agreed upon early on. Helps avoid hurt feelings and legal issues down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like with making games this is a learned skill that takes time to get better at. The more game jams or social projects you work on the better you will get at them. Learn from each experience, keep notes, learn about yourself and what your limits are, learn to read when others are at their limit or overworking themselves. Becoming a leader takes time and is a never ending process so don't feel bad if you mess up once in a while.

        <h1>What Tools Do I Use?</h1>
        <div class="HorizontalLineSeparator"></div>
        <p>
          Right now is the best time in history to make a game. Tools are easier to access and tons of cheap or free versions are available for any discipline. Social programs such as <a href="https://www.guilded.gg/piratesoftware">Guilded</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/piratesoftware">Discord</a> allow people to work together collaboratively from anywhere. With storage solutions like Google Drive and Github we can share files and work without a huge amount of financial buy in.
        </p>
        <div class="HorizontalLineSeparator"></div>
        <h2 id="Engine">There is no best engine.</h2>
        <div class="HorizontalLineSeparator"></div>
        <p>
          Choose an engine that supports your style of game and your financial situation. Don't choose an engine based on what people say is the 'best' engine. There is no 'best' engine. There are great engines for different kinds of games. Tools are not diminished in value based on their price or lack thereof. There are also hundreds of engines available out there. Go <a href="https://enginesdatabase.com/">explore</a> your options!
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/">Doki Doki Literature Club</a> was made in a free to use python tool called <a href="https://www.renpy.org/">Ren'Py</a> that is specifically designed to make visual novels. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain_2013/">Risk of Rain</a> was made in <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en">GameMaker</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210920062120/https://riskofraingame.com/team/">MS Paint</a>. Yes, you read that right... MS Paint. The cost of your tools does not define the value of what you make.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understand that this isn't an exhausive list of engines. There are tons of engines out there that are good or great for a variety of game styles. Go out there, find stuff, build stuff, and don't be an elitist about tools.

              <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> is a beast. Completely built by its community, fully open source, and entirely free. It excels in 3d is great for 2d and is now being used by major studios. You literally can't get a better deal as a small studio than free. Actually free. Not free with royalties. Real free. Use Godot. Seriously. Godot was used to make <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/">Dome Keeper</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124780/Endoparasitic/">Endoparasitic</a>.

              <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en">GameMaker</a> is a great engine for making 2d games but not very strong with 3d. You can use the free trial indefinitely for non-commercial use and it allows exports to Desktop targets as well as Web and Mobile. The monetization model is very competitive at 100$ one time for a lifetime license. For Console it's 80$ per month or 800$ per year. All of these prices have regionalized pricing making it affordable pretty much anywhere. They don't take royalties which is pretty great if your game takes off as well. Game Maker Studio was used to make <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/">Heartbound</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257850/Hyper_Light_Drifter/">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain_2013/">Risk of Rain</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/">Nuclear Throne</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/">Pizza Tower</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/">Undertale</a>.

              <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download">Unreal Engine</a> is a powerhouse in the 3d arena that has a great monetization model. If your game makes under 1,000,000$ over its lifetime you pay them nothing. Anything beyond that has a 5% royalty tagged onto it. They are also entirely free to use for unmonetized projects. Definitely great for startups but it can have a steep learning curve. Unreal was used to make <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/?lang=en-US">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440900/Conan_Exiles/">Conan Exiles</a>, <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/3/us/home/">Kingdom Hearts 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/octopath-traveler-switch/">Octopath Traveler</a>.

          Just like with an engine you should choose an art program that works best for you. Just because a program costs more or is more revered in certain circles doesn't mean it's better for you or your workflow. Everyone works differently and everyone feels more or less comfortable with different software and hardware. If you want to use MS Paint on a tablet it's fine. If you want to use Photoshop on a Cintiq that's also fine.

              <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> is an incredibly fantastic image editing tool generally looked down on for being the ugly brother of photoshop. That being said it has a few super powers that photoshop doesn't have... it's not owned by Adobe and it's completely free. We've used gimp for tons of stuff over the years from promotional art, to touch ups on logos, or making in-game assets. Definitely give this a look if you haven't before.

          I spoke to our musician <a href="http://stijnvanwakeren.com/">Stijn van Wakeren</a> for this information as it's not really my area of expertise. You should definitely hit them up if you have questions about these programs or want more insight into why they are so powerful. That being said, here are some rad programs you can use to make music or sound effects with relative ease.

              <a href="https://famistudio.org/">FamiStudio</a> is an awesome free tool for making NES style chiptunes and sound effects. There is a pretty massive fan community built around it and a ton of easy to follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyECgqFbZPQ">YouTube tutorials</a> to get you started making stuff. I really love the sounds that come out of this thing and it really hits that nostalgia factor. You can even review the <a href="https://github.com/BleuBleu/FamiStudio">source</a> or compile it yourself. Honestly awesome.

              <a href="https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio">FL Studio</a> is by far the gold standard for audio tools. All of our music and sound effects were made in it. It's incredibly easy to use, insanely versatile letting you make a wide range of awesome stuff, and it's pretty affordable with a $100 price tag for lifetime updates. If you're serious about making audio magic and want something powerful and long lasting then FL Studio is the right choice.
